        "# **Practical BlackBox Attack Against ML : Spectrum Simulation Attack**\n",
        "Machine learning models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), can be vulnerable to adversarial examples that is  malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Most of existing adversarial attacks can only fool a black-box model with a low success rate.\n",
        "Black-box attacks often face challenges due to significant differences between the substitute model and the target model, resulting in less effective attacks. While there are methods that attempt to improve attack performance by simulating multiple models using image transformations, the transformations in the spatial domain haven't proven to be very effective. To address this issue, we utilize an attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target model, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target. We also introduce a novel approach: the spectrum simulation attack (SSA). This method transforms the input in the frequency domain, aiming to craft adversarial examples that are more transferable across various models, including those with defenses. The code for our method can be found at: https://github.com/yuyang-long/SSA.\n",

        "The Spectrum Simulation Attack (SSA) introduces a frequency domain-based technique to bolster transferability in adversarial attacks. Traditional adversarial methods in the spatial domain tend to result in non-diverse substitute models, limiting their efficacy. SSA's innovation lies in its utilization of spectrum transformations on input images, shifting the adversarial crafting process to the frequency domain. This approach not only produces diverse substitute models but also crafts adversarial examples with enhanced transferability across both standard and defense models. Central to SSA is the concept of the spectrum saliency map. This map highlights pivotal frequency components, guiding the adversarial perturbation process. By leveraging properties from the frequency domain, SSA ensures that adversarial examples are not only potent against a given model but also maintain their effectiveness when transferred to other models. In essence, SSA's technical differentiation stems from its shift from spatial to frequency domain, and the strategic use of spectrum saliency to target critical frequency components.\n"

The attack offers a fresh perspective on model augmentation, effectively bridging the disparity between substitute and victim models using spectrum-transformed images. When juxtaposed with conventional model augmentation attacks in the spatial domain, the method's superior efficacy becomes evident, significantly surpassing leading transfer-based attack techniques. Testing on the ImageNet dataset showed the method to be highly effective, achieving an average success rate of 95.4% against nine advanced defense models.\n"
